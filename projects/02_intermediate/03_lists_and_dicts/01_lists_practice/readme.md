# **Problem: List Practice**
Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.

Print the length of the list.


Add 'mango' at the end of the list. 


Print the updated list.
